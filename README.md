## Class Description

This course will introduce graduate students to common statistical and machine learning methods used in astronomy and other physical sciences. 
While it will include theoretical and methodological backgrounds for the techniques the focus will be on the application of machine learning to astrophysical problems. To accomplish this we  will utilize modern astronomical datasets. Practical data analysis will be done using python tools, such as astroML module (see www.astroML.org), scikit-learn, and tensorflow/pytorch. While focused on astronomy, this course should be useful to all graduate students interested in data analysis in physical sciences and engineering. The lectures will be aimed at graduate students and the main discussion topics will be based on selected topics from Chapters 6-10, in the reference textbook.

The goal of this course is to give you the tools necessary to
understand and  analyze rich datasets, such as thoose from SDSS to LSST. A prerequisite for this course is ASTR 598A Introduction to Astrostatistics and Data-Intensive Astronomy (offered in the
Autumn quarter).
